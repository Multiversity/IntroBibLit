Canonical Criticism
    Ultimate quesiton = what gets in and what doesn't.
    
Septuagint - LXX (70)
    Earliest translation of Hebrew bible
    People aren't reading Hebrew because the Greeks ruled
    Scholars translated the Hebrew bible into Greek
    Septuagint becomes the first bible of the chruch
    
Marcion
    Thrown out of church because he suggested a canon
    Rejected the Hebrew doctrine
    Said "be a new religion...we should be different...what's all this jewish influence...religion of faith"
    Kicked out all references in the New Testement to Jewish influences
    Kicked out Matthew, John, and Mark
    Edited but kept Luke
