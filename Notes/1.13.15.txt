            Two areas of study
                Historical accuracy
                    Range of dates, sources, not in chronological order
            Example:
                Luke 2
                    Statement: Jesus was born when someone was governor
                Matthew
                    Born in the time of King Herod (4 B.C.E)
                Luke = Confused
                Book of 2nd Kings
                    After Jeboakin was King (597 B.C.E)

                Under a false name - not uncommon
                Honor tradition of that author
